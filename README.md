# Public-Health-Disease-SUrveillance-Architecture-Development
*Project Overview:*
The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project aimed to create a robust system for monitoring and analyzing disease outbreaks, specifically focusing on syndromic surveillance. The project involved setting up virtual machines, configuring databases, installing necessary software like OpenEMR and HAPI FHIR, and implementing REST APIs for seamless data exchange.

*Objectives:*
1. Establish a virtualized environment for disease surveillance.
2. Install and configure OpenEMR for electronic medical records management.
3. Set up a HAPI FHIR server to facilitate FHIR data exchange.
4. Develop RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and data querying.
5. Ensure interoperability and seamless communication between healthcare systems.

*Technologies Used:*
1. VMware for virtualization.
2. OpenEMR for electronic medical records management.
3. HAPI FHIR for implementing the FHIR standard.
4. Docker for containerization.
5. Postman for API testing and development.
6. Swagger UI for API documentation.
7. Synthea for generating synthetic patient data.
8. Ubuntu Server for hosting virtual machines.

*Challenges Faced:*
1. Configuring complex network settings for virtual machines.
2. Ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different software components.
3. Managing resources efficiently within the virtual environment.
4. Troubleshooting issues related to Docker container deployment.
5. Ensuring data security and privacy compliance.

*Outcomes Achieved:*
1. Successfully deployed virtual machines for disease surveillance.
2. Installed and configured OpenEMR for electronic medical records management.
3. Set up a HAPI FHIR server to enable FHIR data exchange.
4. Developed RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and data querying.
5. Tested the system using Postman and ensured proper authentication and error handling.
6. Created synthetic patient data using Synthea for simulation purposes.
7. Documented the entire process for future reference and collaboration.

*Conclusion:*
The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project successfully laid the foundation for a comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing disease outbreaks. By leveraging modern technologies and standards like FHIR, the project aimed to enhance public health decision-making and improve disease surveillance capabilities. Ongoing maintenance and further enhancements will be necessary to ensure the system remains effective and scalable in the long term.
